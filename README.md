This is a random number generator based on Benford's law.

Benford's law states that there are more numbers in nature
that have the first digit as 1, or 2. To be exact, 30% of numbers
have a leading digit of 1 and 17% have a leading digit of 2. They
gradually decrease from there.

If you take the population numbers of all countries in the world,
extract the first digit and graph them on a frequency graph, you
will see the Benford curve.
